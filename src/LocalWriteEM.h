 *
 * This function is used to reduce scalability problem brought about by a
 * traditional global-counter based epoch manager, where each thread has to
 * call EnterEpoch() and LeaveEpoch() on each operation to maintain global
 * counters that counts the number of active threads entering the system
 * at a certain epoch time period. The innovativity of local write epoch
 * manager is that for each operation, the worker thread only needs to
 * conduct a local write to a variable which is only maintained for each CPU
 * core (i.e. explicitly local for L1 cache dedicated to each core), and there
 * is no global synchronization except for the epoch thread. Epoch thread
 * checks each local counter and finds the minimum one. After that it uses
 * the minimum live worker thread's epoch to reclaim garbage nodes whose
 * epoch of deletion < the epoch of oldest living worker thread
